        <p>Now that you have an appropriate amount of your income in your savings, you decide you want to take a 7-day trip to a tropical destination!</p>
        <p>Below, you are to plan your trip by budgeting the money you put into your savings.</p>
        <p>You will need to decide what kind of transportation and living accomadations you wish to purchase before leaving on your trip.</p>
        <p>Different options will boost your happiness on the trip!</p>
        <p>Then, you will need to decide how much of your remaining money you want to budget for food and recreation.</p>
        <p>You are not required to follow the suggested amount or use all of your savings if you do not wish.</p>
        <p>However! You will not be able to change these amounts once you start your trip.</p>
        <p>While on your trip a day will consist of 3 meals and 2 recreational activities that you will get to choose from.</p>
        <p>The goal is to make it through the 7 days without running out of money from the budgeted amounts while enjoying your trip.</p>
