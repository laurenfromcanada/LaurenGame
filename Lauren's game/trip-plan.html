        <p id="urMom">Now that you have an appropriate amount of your income in your savings, you decide you want to take a 7-day trip to a tropical destination!
        Below, you are to plan your trip by budgeting the money you put into your savings.
        You will need to decide what kind of transportation and living accomadations you wish to purchase before leaving on your trip.
        Different options will boost your happiness on the trip!
        Then, you will need to decide how much of your remaining money you want to budget for food and recreation.
        You are not required to follow the suggested amount or use all of your savings if you do not wish.
        However! You will not be able to change these amounts once you start your trip.
        While on your trip a day will consist of 3 meals and 2 recreational activities that you will get to choose from.
        The goal is to make it through the 7 days without running out of money from the budgeted amounts while enjoying your trip.</p>
