    <main id="trip-plan-grid">
        <p>Now that you have decided what is an appropriate amount of your annual income to spend towards your trip, you need to decide on how much money you plan on spending on each of the following categories. Your trip will consist of a 7 day vacation to a nice warm tropical place. For each category, there is a suggested amount that for how much to spend, but it is not mandatory that you follow it. This is your money, so you can budget it how you see fit for your wants and needs. It is up to you to decide how you want to spend your trip! You do not need to spend all of your money right now. Can you budget your trip spending money accordingly to what you wish to do on your trip? Remember, not everything happens as planned. Best of luck planning.</p>
