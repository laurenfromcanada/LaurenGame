    <p>While on your trip a day will consist of 3 meals and 2 recreational activities that you will get to choose from. 
        Each meal and activity will also have different amounts of happiness points that will go towards the daily minimum of 200 happiness points. 
        The goal is to make it through the 7 days without running out of money from the budgeted amounts while enjoying your trip.</p>
